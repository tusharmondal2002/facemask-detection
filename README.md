facemask detection
In order to assess whether or not a user is wearing a mask, Face Mask Detection employs an Artificial Network. The programme may be connected to any new or existing IP mask detection cameras in order to detect people without masks. Users can add faces and phone numbers to receive notifications if those around are not not wearing a mask.Â If the camera captures an unknown face, the administrator will receive a notification.
